# CLAUDE.md — The Clockwork Dark

This file guides Claude Code (and other coding agents) when working in this repository.

## Start here

1. **Read** [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) — vision, mechanics, glossary, architecture
2. **Read** [docs/DESIGN_REVIEW.md](docs/DESIGN_REVIEW.md) — what the overhaul found and what is still open
3. **Read** [docs/CLAUDE_CODE_BRIEF.md](docs/CLAUDE_CODE_BRIEF.md) — build spec and golden rules. Parts of it are historical and marked **CURRENT:** where they have drifted
4. For visual/asset work, use [docs/CLAUDE_DESIGN_BRIEF.md](docs/CLAUDE_DESIGN_BRIEF.md) instead
5. For story/content work — creating a story, editing a `games/<slug>/` tree,
   or using the authoring tools — read [docs/AUTHORING.md](docs/AUTHORING.md)
   first. It is the document that replaces reading engine source for that job

Authority order when they disagree: **the code**, then DESIGN.md, then
DESIGN_REVIEW.md, then CLAUDE_CODE_BRIEF.md.

## Critical rules

1. **Engine resolves mechanics; LLMs narrate.** All dice, combat, inventory, and travel go through `@skill` tools.
2. **`clock.advance_time` is the only writer of world time.** `world_day`, `world_hour` and `time_of_day` are derived read-only properties.
3. **`effects.apply_effect` is the only writer of game state.** Quest rewards, boons, encounter outcomes and death all funnel through it.
4. **Never use bare `random`.** Use `world_rng(state, STREAM)` so a seed replays and one system's rolls do not shift another's.
5. **Never hardcode** ports, model names, or paths — use `config/default.yaml` via `get_config()`. Machine-specific paths go in `config/local.yaml` (gitignored, deep-merged).
6. **Never gate rest.** It is the only thing that restores stamina; a gate rebuilds a soft-lock the game shipped with.
7. **Reuse patterns** from [CosySim](https://github.com/nihilistau/CosySim) and [Archives of Anubis](https://github.com/nihilistau/Achieves-Of-Anubis) before writing new code.
8. **Prove with tests** — run `pytest` before declaring work complete. Expect fully green, no `xfail`.
9. **Do not document a mechanism you did not wire.** Mark it **NOT WIRED** with its file. A design doc describing code that never runs is how this codebase got into trouble.
10. **Run `scripts/simulate.py` before changing a balance constant.** Every number here was originally chosen against a clock that did not tick.
11. **Windows-aware** — LM Studio at `http://localhost:1234/v1`; use `scripts/start.ps1` or `launcher.py --stack`.

## Project summary

Local-first AI RPG: deterministic hard engine + two autonomous agents (Storyteller + Assistant). ComfyUI/Grok images, local Voxtral TTS/STT — all generation off by default; the shipped art pack and text fallbacks are what runs out of the box. Player starts at the forest edge; evil ticks in the background whether they become a hero or a baker.

## Status

**PR1–PR12 complete. Overhaul phases P1–P11 complete. Overhaul II waves 1–2
complete.** ~1400 tests passing, no expected failures. Run `pytest` for the
real number rather than trusting this line — it has been stale before.

The engine/story seam is the current work. What landed: the multi-agent turn
(plan → negotiate → commit, `engine/agents/pipeline.py`), the finale chain
(lock → Speak·Act·Seal → epilogue), a story-declared UI plugin (`ui.plugin`),
and the removal of one story's content from the engine's defaults. What that
last one fixed is worth stating plainly, because it was invisible for months:
every story that omitted a `paths.*` key silently read The Clockwork Dark's
content, and every story that omitted `paths.prompts` got a narrator who
introduced itself as the Storyteller of The Clockwork Dark.

Also landed since: `craft_item` with degree outcomes, foraging that discovers
hidden-path travel shortcuts, carry weight priced on travel (never on rest),
the served notice board (`GET /api/notices`), and the safety layer wired
end-to-end — input review, a pre-commit `SafetyCeiling`, and narration review
with fade cards (docs/SAFETY.md; UI render of the card is the open half).

Two games ship: `clockwork-dark` (flagship) and `wicked-garden`. Pick one with
`launcher.py --game <slug>`.

`drowned-carillon` was **deleted**. It was the flagship with different nouns,
which made it a poor proof of the engine/story seam — it could not fail in any
way the flagship would not, and it had rotted unnoticed. The Wicked Garden is
the second story now, and it shares almost nothing with the flagship, which is
the point.

Closed: **R-01** (prompt budget overflow), **R-02** (`SceneRulesEngine` never
called), **R-03** (the clock — 10.02 → 4.40 mean h/turn, deaths 129 → 35),
**R-05** (no repeatable food economy — foraging closes it; the `pauper` policy
now survives 200 turns spending zero gold), **R-06** (the doomsday clock now
answers to conduct: widened per-location multipliers plus earned
`doom_resistance` put the disengaged baker at 2.03× the engaged hero's evil
per in-game day — 0.0143 vs 0.0070 — where every playstyle used to land
within 13%; the median 200-turn run ends in SPREADING; measured by the new
`hero` policy in `scripts/simulate.py`).

The design review's open-issue list is empty.

See [docs/DESIGN_REVIEW.md](docs/DESIGN_REVIEW.md) for the measurements behind
each, and the **NOT WIRED** tables in [docs/GOVERNANCE.md](docs/GOVERNANCE.md)
for what is built but not yet called.
