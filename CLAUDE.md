# CLAUDE.md — The Clockwork Dark

@AGENTS.md

Everything above is imported from [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md): the start-here reading
list, the twelve critical rules, the working conventions, verification and the
canon ids. They live there once, tool-neutral, so no second copy can drift.
**Change a rule in AGENTS.md, never here.** This file carries only what changes
release to release.

## Status

**v0.8.1** is the current release (CHANGELOG.md has every release since 0.4.0).

**2023 passing, 3 skipped in 4m58s**, no expected failures (measured
2026-09-23), plus **138 client tests** under `ui/tests/` (`npm test --prefix ui`;
`vitest` is a devDependency, so `npm install --prefix ui` once first). Re-measure
and restate these at every release rather than trusting this line -- it has been
stale before, in the very sentence that warned about it.

Five stories ship, and every one can be played to an ending
(`tests/test_finales.py`): `clockwork-dark` (the flagship), `wicked-garden`
(the deck exemplar), `neon-city` (NEON CITY: THE CROSSING), `the-long-con` (THE
LONG CON, the first graph/deck hybrid) and `dev-story` (the annotated bench).
Pick one with `launcher.py --game <slug>`.

## In flight

**HUE & CRY**, approved 2026-09-23 as three releases:

| Release | What | State |
|---|---|---|
| v0.8 | The audit release: presence in every story, outcome-aware evaluator, the "world moved" journal, leaks, dead code | **shipped** |
| v0.9 | Four generic engine features, each proven against the new story as it grows: the Law, Premises, Jobs & flashbacks, Agendas | next |
| v1.0 | `hue-and-cry` itself: a thief mistaken for "the Magpie" in the candle-port of Tallowmere, eight endings, bespoke UI plugin, Grok art pack | after v0.9 |

Spec: [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-23-hue-and-cry-design.md](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-23-hue-and-cry-design.md).
Plans live in `docs/superpowers/plans/`; v0.9 is executed subagent-driven, one
fresh subagent per task with review between.

## Deliberately deferred

Recorded rather than fixed, so nobody mistakes them for forgotten work:

- neon-city ships **zero** art plates against 75 subjects, its entry location
  included.
- The Wicked Garden has 11 of 23 endings unreachable and 4 orphan cards.
- `mortal_threshold`, the Garden's entry location, has no plate on purpose (it
  hosts the ten-card prologue), so a new player sees no scene art until the
  prologue ends.
- The studio review queue can keep one draft but does not draft from the
  browser.
- The NOT WIRED tables: [docs/GOVERNANCE.md](docs/GOVERNANCE.md),
  [docs/STATE.md](docs/STATE.md), [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md).

## What the passes found

The full accounts -- measured, with the reasoning -- are in
[docs/DESIGN_REVIEW.md § Findings after the overhaul](docs/DESIGN_REVIEW.md#findings-after-the-overhaul).
The one-line index, because each is a mistake worth not repeating:

- **A test IS a caller.** Three subsystems and eleven skills had no production
  caller and full test coverage; `tests/test_reachability.py` now walks the
  engine's own call graph, constants included.
- **Reached is not narrated.** Threads, clocks and -- in four of five stories --
  presence itself were enforced and invisible to the prose.
- **Narrated is not agreed.** The evaluator asked whether a roll existed, never
  whether the prose matched it; `work` reported how a shift went under the key
  meaning whether it happened.
- **Tests were talking to LM Studio** while believing they were mocked; the
  conftest guard asserts at teardown because the pipeline's forgiveness
  swallowed a raise.
- **State outlived its test** twice: a module memo (`_DOOM_DECLARED`) and a story
  activation. Both have autouse fixtures now.
- **A veneer hid a template.** THE LONG CON sold "Hedge Berries" as cigarettes
  through a `name:` key nothing read.

## Machine notes (this workstation)

- The default pytest temp directory is unreadable here (WinError 5, environmental).
  Pass `--basetemp="C:/Users/Knack/AppData/Local/Temp/claude/ptmp"`.
- Heredocs and `python -c` strings lose backticks to shell command
  substitution; write commit messages and patch scripts to a file first.
