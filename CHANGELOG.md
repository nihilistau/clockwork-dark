# Changelog

All notable changes to The Clockwork Dark.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
this project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) —
loosely, since nothing imports this as a library. A MINOR bump is a release the
player or the author would notice; a PATCH is repair.

**Entries before 0.4.0 were written after the fact**, from the commits
themselves. Nothing was kept at the time, so they are shorter and less certain
than what follows. `git log` is the authority for anything before 0.4.0; this
file is the authority from 0.4.0 on.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-20

### Added

- **Accept one draft.** `POST /api/studio/draft/accept` promotes a single draft
  entry into the live tree, with `Author.promote_one` doing the placement so the
  studio and `scripts/author.py --promote` cannot disagree about where a file
  lands. `--promote` is all-or-nothing and refuses while any error stands; the
  review queue exists precisely so an author can keep one and discard the rest.
- **The notice board reaches the browser.** `GET /api/notices` has been served
  since Overhaul III and no player could see it. `Notices.jsx` is a
  clockwork-dark overlay (`n`) with its own pinned-paper mark. Closes a
  **NOT WIRED** row in `docs/GOVERNANCE.md`.
- **Challenge and scene framing.** `BeatFrame.jsx` draws the "step 2 of 4" /
  "card 3 of 7" line, so a gauntlet reads as one thing rather than four
  unrelated turns. It invents nothing: titles, cursors and lengths all come off
  the turn payload. The full panel remains unbuilt and stays in the table.
- **THE LONG CON gets its own ledger** and theme, instead of wearing the graph
  template's right column.

### Changed

- **Onboarding is remembered per story, not globally.** The flag was one key for
  the whole install, so meeting the flagship taught the client that you had met
  NEON CITY too, and four of the five games never introduced themselves.
- **NEON CITY says `NO FEED`** where a plate is missing, rather than rendering a
  gap. The game ships zero art plates against 75 subjects; this makes the
  absence read as the canon's own dead screen instead of as a broken image.
- **Core copy stopped speaking for the flagship.** The default player name was
  `Traveler` and the seed hint said "Same seed, same village" — one story's
  nouns in the engine's own neutral client. Now `You` and "same world".

### Fixed

- `engine/studio/api.py` inserted `scripts/` into `sys.path` inside its request
  handlers, so every scaffold and every accept pushed another copy of the same
  string onto a process-wide list that nothing popped. Both call sites now go
  through one idempotent `_script_module`.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-08-15

### Added

- The engine-scope rule in `CLAUDE.md` (rule 12), so that a later session
  finding the absence undocumented does not reintroduce what 0.3.0 removed.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-08-15

### Removed

- **Prompt composition is story-owned.** The engine no longer injects register
  or content-tier directives into the storyteller prompt or the story-drafting
  prompt. The package, config block, per-game blocks, settings dial and client
  card that carried them are gone — 40 files, 5,207 deletions. Register is set
  by `games/<slug>/prompts/storyteller.md` and by the model the owner has
  loaded, which is not the engine's business.

The governance commit chain keeps its veto: a hook can still block a turn, and
nothing is written when one does.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-15

Reconstructed from `git log`; see those commits for detail.

- **Overhaul III — reachability.** Three subsystems and eleven registered skills
  had no production caller: the deck system (so the Wicked Garden could not be
  finished by playing it), `clocks.forced_scenes`, `set_pieces` and `threads`.
  All wired, with `tests/test_reachability.py` walking the engine's own call
  graph so it stays that way. The suite dropped from 15m32s to a third of that
  once four paths that were reaching a live LM Studio from tests were closed.
- **THE LONG CON** — the first hybrid: a full graph city that also declares
  decks and a clock.
- **A studio** — author a story without a terminal.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-20 … 2026-08-14

Reconstructed from `git log`; see those commits for detail.

The engine and the first games: deterministic core (single writers for time and
state, seeded RNG streams), the two-agent turn, the multi-agent
plan → negotiate → govern → commit pipeline, quests, economy, survival,
encounters, endings and epilogues, the React client with per-story plugins,
and five shipped games.
